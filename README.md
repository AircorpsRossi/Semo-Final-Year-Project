# Semo-Final-Year-Project
This is my final year project for 4th Year Computer Engineering.
In this repository, I have attached the files I felt necessary to create a Hosted Website which displays parsed email data from a source, info@sem-o.com.
The hosted website displayed parsed email information that was stored in a created MySQL database. 
The lanaguages and tools necessary for the completion of the project are as follows:
Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Visual Studio, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, C#, .NET Framework, HTML, JS, and a Logic App using Azure.
